We build Whack-a-mole in react native

In this video (https://youtu.be/yrSFLZ_b0Aw) , we will be using Expo.io  to help us build a simple game of whack-a-mole using react-native. We will also be using react hooks and redux state management.

By the end of this video, you will have learned how to:
- use your mobile phone to run your app (iOS and Android)
- set up an iOS simulator on your computer to run your app
- set up an Android Simulator on your computer to run your app
